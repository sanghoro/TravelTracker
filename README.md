# Travel Tracker

## Abstract
  -Travel Tracker is an application that helps users plan, track, and manage their trips! Users can log in, view past and upcoming trips, book new trips, and calculate travel estimates. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Enjoy.

## Learning Goals
  -To practice FETCH and POST: understand and implement GET/POST requests from the backend.
  -CSS styling: experiment with different CSS properties, using flexbox and grid to create responsive layouts.
  -JS functionality: implement event listeners to handle user interactions and make user experience better!
  -Version control: using Github to make myself comfortable with workflow
  
## Challenges
  -Handling data with FETCH and POST: Using Poromise.all to fetch data requests and process them was still challenging to me, however, I plan to hone my skills over the two week break.
  -Dynamic UI updates: It was challenging to design/research/try out multiple layouts to make the best of UI design
  -Decoupling functions from dependencies: I had to separate some functions that were fetching datas directly from the backend dataset. I have spent 10+ hours on restructuring and decoupling functions and make them indirectly access the backend dataset. It was exhausting, but definitely worth it.
  
## Wins
  -I managed to create a user-friendly interface with various CSS styles, making the application look appealing.
  -I almost gave up on separating the functions from their dependencies because I was nearly done with the project, my internet was out most of the day, and there was construction noise in my apartment. But I didn’t give up, and I pushed through to get it done.

## Special Thanks to
  -Reese for dedicating his time and effort to carefully review my projects and provide valuable feedback.
